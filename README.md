I'm a computer science researcher. I recieved BSc degree in applied mathematics and changed my major to computer engineering during master @ Iran University of Science and Technology (ranked #1 amongst all universities in Iran by Times Higher Education rankings in 2017). I started my PhD journey with the [Distributed Systems and Communications lab (DISCO)](https://www.kau.se/en/cs/research/research-areas/computer-networking-disco/disco-distributed-systems-and-communications "DISCO lab") @ Karlstad University (KAU) in Sweden. During my PhD, I worked in Ericsson Research and Development department as a research intern and directly contributed on projects related to optimization of 5G testbeds. During my short time in Ericsson, beside multiple published paper, I've also invented a method for modeling and optimizing massive cloud systems and filed a related patent together with my other collegue @Ericsson.
